  description: The Centre will revolutionise predictions of the future of East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Changes in the Antarctic will be profoundly costly to Australia, including sea-level and fisheries impacts; but the speed and scale of future change remains poorly understood. A new national-scale and interdisciplinary Centre is required to understand the complex interactions of the ocean, ice sheets, atmosphere and ecosystems that will govern Antarctica’s future. The Centre will combine new field data with innovative models to address Australia’s Antarctic science priorities, train graduate students, develop leaders, engage the public, and enable major economic benefit as Australia adapts to climate change in the coming years and beyond.

  subtitle: Ocean heat content change and its impact on sea level

  description: This project aims to improve projections of possible sea level changes. Sea level rise is among the most significant potential impacts of transient climate change around the world. Poor understanding of the way in which heat is absorbed at the sea surface and distributed by ocean circulation is a leading source of uncertainty in projections of global surface temperature and regional sea level rise by the end of this century. This project aims to apply novel observational methods, complimented by numerical modelling, to quantify the drivers of recent change. This project expects to transform our ability to predict how ocean temperature and sea level will change in the future.

  description: The oceans have absorbed more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide (CO2) that humans release to the atmosphere, a process that substantially slows the pace of climate change. However, this ocean "sink" for CO2 is not constant - observational estimates based on surface ocean measurements suggest it changed little through the 1990s, but after 2000 it began to increase rapidly. The reasons for this variability are not understood. Earth system models for the climate and carbon cycle do not capture the variation, indicating fundamental deficiencies in the models. This is a major problem because the models are our tools to project how the climate will change in the future. Changes in the physical circulation of the ocean, or its biogeochemistry, may be responsible for the observed variability - or perhaps sparse observations in earlier decades have biased observations and exaggerated the variability. In UNICORNS we will bring several newly developed techniques to resolve these questions. (1) We will apply several machine learning methods to observations of the ocean interior, to reconstruct the ocean carbon content in greater detail than previously possible. This will enable us to test whether the time history of the carbon inventory as revealed by the interior observations, is consistent with that deduced from surface measurements. This will provide an independent test of the apparent sink variability. (2) To examine possible ocean circulation mechanisms that could cause the variability, we will adapt and apply a novel "inverse" technique that constructs budgets for temperature and salinity within water masses. This can explicitly derive regional mixing and transport, changes that could lead to the variable carbon sink. (3) Much of the sink variability may be attributable to changes in circulation redistributing "natural" carbon that has been in the ocean since pre-industrial times. We will apply a framework that explicitly identifies added and redistributed carbon to model output to examine this hypothesis and to evaluate the results of our inverse method. Different techniques used in the literature define the split between "anthropogenic" and natural, pre-existing carbon, in different ways and with this part of our project we will aim to bring more clarity to this distinction. Our results will enable a more assured interpretation of the global carbon budget over recent decades, improvements to carbon-climate models, and more confident projections of future climate.

  description: This project is concerned with measuring changes in global rainfall and ensuring that computer models of the climate can predict how rainfall will change in the future. As carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are continually added to the atmosphere, it is understood that the temperature of the surface of the earth will rise. Warmer air can hold more moisture, so as the Earth warms the rate at which the atmosphere extracts water from the surface of the earth and dumps it back as rain will also increase. Knowing precisely how much global rates of rainfall will change into the future is important to many people including farmers wanting to know which crops to plant and nations wanting to build domestic water and hydroelectric infrastructure. Measuring the total rainfall around the world is no mean feat. On land, measurements are made directly (by catching the rain) or by reliable 'indirect' methods based on river flow and how wet the soil is. However, two-thirds of the globe is covered by ocean. It is hard to catch rain in the middle of the ocean without actually being there to do it. Although many 'indirect' methods exist for measuring rainfall over the ocean there is great uncertainty about how much rainfall has changed over the ocean in the last 50 years or so. Thankfully there is a solution. The ocean itself acts as a giant rain catcher. Water that falls as rain is fresh water, like the water we drink. Most of the ocean however, is very salty. So the more rain that falls, the fresher the ocean water gets and the more evaporation that occurs the saltier the ocean water gets. Oceanographers can measure just how salty the water in the ocean is and have been doing so regularly for more than 50 years now. The question remains however, how do you turn measurements of the salinity of the ocean into measurement of how much rain has fallen? Well, by looking all around the globe and counting up how much more salty water there is and how much fresh water there is, researchers can estimate how much water has been evaporated in one place and fallen as rain in another. The researchers involved in this project will do this using all the observations of salinity in the ocean taken over the last 50 years. They will estimate just how much rainfall has changed. They will compare this with computer models which are commonly used to predict what will happen in the future to see how accurate they are and how they can be improved.
