Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate at Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC), UNSW and working on Detection and Attribution of Global Ocean Heat Uptake, circulation, Sea-level change and variability. My research focuses to improve the current understanding of global and regional heat uptake and sea-level change under the influence of anthropogenic forcing and natural variabilities using observations and CMIP5/6 model outputs. I am also interested to understand the internal variability of the climate system to better quatify the heat and moisture transport.
