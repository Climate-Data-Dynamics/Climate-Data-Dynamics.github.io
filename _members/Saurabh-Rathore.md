I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New South Wales Sydney.

My research interests lie in studying the processes which drive ocean heat and freshwater changes, ocean ventilation and large-scale circulation, both globally and in the Southern Ocean. I study the role of convection and turbulence in driving mixing, as well as the broader role of ocean mixing and surface fluxes in driving large-scale ocean changes.  
I use a variety of tools in my research, including high-resolution, idealised direct numerical simulations (DNS) and novel water mass transformation frameworks, to elucidate the role of mixing, turbulence and surface fluxes in the ocean.
