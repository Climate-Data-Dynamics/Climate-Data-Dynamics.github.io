I am an Associate Professor in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. I carry out fundamental research on the role of the ocean and water in the changing climate. I have led teams of researchers who used ocean observations to demonstrate that as the climate warms, the water cycle is amplifying. My research has helped establish that the atmosphere is unlikely to become more energetic (windier overall) in a warming climate as having more water in the system makes the atmospheric heat engine less efficient.
