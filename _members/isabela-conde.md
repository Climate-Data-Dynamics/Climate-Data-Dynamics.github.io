I am a current PhD student in applied mathematics at UNSW, focusing on physical oceanography. I completed my Honours in Mathematics at the University of Queensland in 2022, and started my PhD in 2023. 

My research aims to investigate the drivers and impacts of sea surface temperature variability in the tropics, using statistical methods and mathematical modelling. Through my research, I hope to contribute to a better understanding of how the heat content of the ocean will change with climate change and how this will affect various physical processes.
