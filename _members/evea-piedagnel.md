I'm in my final year of a geophysics engineering degree at EOST in Strasbourg, France. Through this program I’m undertaking a 6-month internship with Jan Zika at UNSW.

My internship focuses on developing a model to infill missing salinity data using temperature and pressure observation in the ocean. I’m also interested in the Southern Ocean and how it affects global ocean patterns.
